  ###  General Form Guidelines    
  #### Input Width
  Input width can inform a user's understanding of the required text input. While it can be convenient to keep fields a consistent width from a development perspective, providing appropriate field widths for input such as postal codes and expiration dates communicate if the answer should be short or long. 
  #### Button Placement
  Proximal button placement is essential within forms. If a submit button is located off-screen or far away from the form itself, a user will have a difficult time making the connection that the form and button are related. 
  #### Highlighted Field Groups
  Another consumer confidence booster is to provide a distinct highlighting around fields which require sensitive information. Again, while this does not provide technical security, it provides perceived security to the user.

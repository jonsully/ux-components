  ###  Floating Label  
  Floating field labels allow for more compact form layout and are especially useful within mobile layouts due to the limited vertical screen real-estate when the device keyboard is active. In the unfocused state, the label presents as a field placeholder. When focused, the label ‘floats’ to the top of the input field, still providing a reference for the requested input.

<div class="field">
      <label for="floatingLabel">Floating Label</label>
      <input type="text" id="floatingLabel" name="firstNameTextField" placeholder="Floating Label">
</div>
